# Requirement to Delivery Traceability – ERP Projects

## Purpose
Ensure end-to-end traceability from business needs to system delivery,
minimizing gaps, rework, and scope leakage.

## Traceability Concept
Every approved requirement must be:
- Designed
- Built or configured
- Tested
- Deployed
- Governed

## Traceability Mapping Model
